# latent-trees

This is the code-base for the final project for Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing

The `master` branch has the basic SPINN implemented.

As the other experiments were performed over SPINN and were not related to each other, 
they have been added as different branches.


`bispinn` has the code for Bi-LSTM, optionally using the modeling layer.

`reinforce` has batched reinforce implemented

`ir_snli` experiments with Information Retrieval based rescoring  

`attention` explores addition of attention from premise to hypothesis

`continuous-stack` implements the discussed continuous stack
